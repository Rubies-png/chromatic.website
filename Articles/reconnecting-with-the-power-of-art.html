<header><h2>Reconnecting With The Power Of Art</h2></header>
<p>I want to reconnect people with the power of my art, talent and ideas.</p>
<p>Allowing my innovative mindset to run free and wild through my mindset.</p>
<p>I hope to bring many together through mind stimulating and propelling art, anyting can be be in form of art.</p>
<p>Our speeches for example is an art, the way we dress, express ourselves, how we think, our interest and so on.</p>
<p>I have met variuous obstacles and have overcame them.There are so many with many great ideas who quite this thought and keep them hidden.</p>
<p>But, i promise if you let those ideas roam free no matter how different you think you are, difference is key and that what would build you.</p>
<p>And i say "diference is what art is all about" express those thoughts and explore these various ideas with me.</p>
<p>By making youtube videos I'll be able to document my own process of reconnecting with the power of art, as art involves Life Long Learning because i'm still in the process of exploring varioud ideas.</p>
<p>Join me on this thrilling jorney as we dive into and explore what art is all about.</p>
